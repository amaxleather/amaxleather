      <h3>Leather</h3>
      <p>Dyed-through top grain leather with different premium finishing options to choose from: Antique handrubbed,
        Distressed, Semi Aniline, Pull up, and Corrected</p>
      <h3>Frame</h3>
      <p>Our frames are Kiln-dried. The process removes most of the moisture inside the wood thereby prolonging its
        life. Due to the moisture reduction, wood doesnâ€™t warp or shrink with changes in humidity and temperature.
        L-braced hardwood frames, glued at the corners, add to the durability and longevity of our products</p>
      <h3>Spring</h3>
      <p>Pocketed-coils and No-Sag springs provide balanced weight distribution offering maximum durability and lasting
        comfort. Pocketed-coil spring systems have separate springs individually wrapped in fabric that allows each
        pocketed spring to move independently, thereby responding quickly to movement and conforming to the contours of
        your body</p>
      <h3>Seat Cushion</h3>
      <p>Down feather and 2.25lbs density foam core are double-wrapped with hollow fill fiber to create a plush seat
        cushion</p>
