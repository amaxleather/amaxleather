      <p>Gently wiping your leather once a week with a clean dry or slightly damp soft cloth to avoid build-up of dirt
        and dust. Avoid using chemical cleaners as it can discolor a patch on your furniture.</p>
      <h3>Spills</h3>
      <p>Clean up spills immediately by dabbing with a soft cloth. For greasy stains, a colorless soap can be used,
        wiping the stain from the outside towards the center. Remove any residual soap with a damp white cloth, and dry
        the area with a clean white towel. Never use heat to hasten drying.</p>
