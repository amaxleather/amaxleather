To keep your leather and cushions new and fluffy, use the seating areas evenly. It is also important not to lean, sit or reach over the back of the sofa as any pulling or tugging might result in a tear.</p>\n<p>Allowing pets on your leather furniture is not recommended. Their claws and saliva can harm the leather finish.</p>\n<h3>Room Temperature</h3>\n<p>Position your leather furniture away from direct sunlight, high-wattage lights, heating and air conditioning units to prevent leather from drying out.</p>\n"
