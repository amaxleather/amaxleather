      <h3>Caring Tips</h3>
      <p>It is normal for seat cushions to become ‘worn in’ and soften overtime. In order to ensure that cushions return
        to their intended look, you can simply massage or smooth the cushions by hand. Do not jump on the sofa, or sit
        on the arm or back.</p>
      <h3>Furniture Handling</h3>
      <p>If the sofa needs to be moved, avoid lifting from the armrest and arm pillows; the correct way to move the sofa
        is by lifting from the base or underside of the arms. Never move the sofa by pushing or pulling it.</p>
