      <p>Leather furniture can last longer and look better by proper care to preserve its natural characteristics.</p>
      <h3>Genuine Leather Characteristics</h3>
      <p>It is important to remember that due to its genuine features, leather has natural wrinkles as well as slight
        color and texture variations. Hence, leather furniture gives a completely natural look and feel to your
        home.</p>

      <h3>Leather Furniture Guide</h3>
      <p>Leather has limited elasticity. To keep your leather and cushions new and fluffy, use the seating areas evenly.
        It is also important not to lean, sit or reach over the back of the sofa as any pulling or tugging might result
        in a tear.</p>
      <p>Allowing pets on your leather furniture is not recommended. Their claws and saliva can harm the leather
        finish.</p>
      <h3>Room Temperature</h3>
      <p>Position your leather furniture away from direct sunlight, high-wattage lights, heating and air conditioning
        units to prevent leather from drying out.</p>
